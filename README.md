# Trust Ogor — Portfolio

Modern startup-style personal site built for GitHub Pages.

This repository contains the source for my professional landing page highlighting experience, projects, and areas of focus across talent strategy, technology, and AI-driven business thinking.

---

## Live Site

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the site is available at:

```
https://trustogor.github.io/trust/
```

---

## Site Overview

The landing page is designed with a clean, minimal, tech-startup aesthetic and includes:

* Sticky glassmorphic navigation bar
* Responsive mobile layout with hamburger menu
* Dark mode toggle with persistence
* Scroll-triggered animations
* Structured sections for About, Projects, Experience, and Thinking

---

## Repository Structure

Typical layout:

```
index.html
assets/
    resume.pdf
README.md
```

---

## Updating Content

All site content lives inside `index.html`.

To update the site:

1. Open `index.html`
2. Edit text within sections (About, Projects, etc.)
3. Commit changes to the repository
4. GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy

---

## Adding / Updating Resume

Upload your resume PDF into the `assets` folder:

```
assets/resume.pdf
```

If using a different filename, update the link inside `index.html`:

```html
<a href="/assets/Your_File_Name.pdf" target="_blank">View Resume</a>
```

---

## Enabling GitHub Pages

In repository settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Pages**
2. Source → Deploy from branch
3. Branch → `main` (root)
4. Save

Deployment usually completes within ~1 minute.
